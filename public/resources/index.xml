      <description>Table of Contents      Prepare the input data Initialize and preprocess     Prepare the input data To perform gene set enrichment analysis for single dataset, you must preprare the following inputs:
1. a named numeric vector of phenotypes (normally this would be a vector of genes with log2 fold change).
2. a list of gene set collections (could be generated by HTSanalyzeR2 or use customized gene sets).</description>

      <description>Table of Contents    Enriched subnetwork analysis  Prepare input, initialize and preprocess Perform analysis and view the identified subnetwork Summarize results     
Enriched subnetwork analysis You can also perform subnetwork analysis (Beisser (2010), Dittrich MT (2008)) to extract the subnetwork enriched with nodes which are associated with a significant phenotype using HTSanalyzeR2. The network can either be fetched by our package to download specific species network from BioGRID database or defined by users.</description>
